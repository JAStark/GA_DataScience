# # Logistic regression exercise with Titanic data

# ## Introduction
# 
# - Data from Kaggle's Titanic competition: [data](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT8/blob/master/data/titanic.csv), [data dictionary](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
# - **Goal**: Predict survival based on passenger characteristics
# - `titanic.csv` is already in our repo, so there is no need to download the data from the Kaggle website

# ## Step 1: Read the data into Pandas

# ## Step 2: Create X and y
# 
# Define **Pclass** and **Parch** as the features, and **Survived** as the response.

# ## Step 3: Split the data into training and testing sets

# ## Step 4: Fit a logistic regression model and examine the coefficients
# 
# Confirm that the coefficients make intuitive sense.

# ## Step 5: Make predictions on the testing set and calculate the accuracy

# ## Step 6: Compare your testing accuracy to the null accuracy
