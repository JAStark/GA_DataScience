The third was a Louisiana police officer who believed he had spoken to the girl several days before she was killed.  He recalled that he believed she was a runaway and had either a friend or sister in Las Vegas.  He believed he remembered a thick cajun accent.

These are the cranial remains of an adult male approximately 20-35 years of age, who has a mixture of Caucasoid and Mongoloid (European and Asian or American Indian) morphological traits. Social identity could have been either, or a mixture. Synostosis of the sagittal suture alters cranial morphology, making this biological profile (age, sex, and ancestry) problematic. This individual has an older style of dental restoration (according to the original dental analysis in 1995), apparently in contrast with the short estimated postmortem interval and young age. An alternate interpretation is to suggest that the dental restoration was done outside the United States.
The cranium was recovered in October 1995 in a fishing net thrown 15 feet off of a bridge into a tidal creek 3-4 feet deep. No other remains were recovered. Exfoliation, degradation, and erosion suggest a minimum exposure time in a tidal environment of several months. A young adult Balanus eburneus barnacle 11.1 mm long and 8.0 mm tall was found attached to the hard palate; it was analyzed by forensic marine biologist consultant Dr. John H. Dearborn. Its size indicates less than a year of growth, which coupled with the normal spring colonization of B. eburneus, and the necessity for a skeletonized surface for it to attach, suggests a time of death during the first few months of 1995. A longer postmortem interval under more complex taphonomic conditions cannot be ruled out.",Delaware,0,NA,1,",

These remains represent a 35 to 70 year old male of either Native American or Anglocaucasian
(non-Mestizo) ancestry and unknown stature.

The general impression is that this material represents a “found object” that had previously been
buried. Although likely of early historical origins (slight reaction to 3M HCl; slight florescence
of cortex in cross section), forensic significance cannot be ruled out.

Staff report 
MOUNT PLEASANT  A family on a fishing excursion Sunday afternoon found a human skull near the base of the Wando Bridge, authorities said. 

The Charleston County Coroner's Office confirmed the skull was human, but did not know how long it had been there. Testing was expected to take at least a week, Deputy Coroner Dottie Lindsay said. An initial inspection did not reveal any obvious signs of trauma. 

A Mount Pleasant couple and their two sons, ages 10 and 11, were in their small boat when the husband spotted a black object on the shoreline around 2 p.m., according to a police report. At first he thought it was an anchor. 

After calling 911, the husband scooped up the skull with a life preserver and moved it farther up the bank so the rising tide would not carry it away, the report states. The family met Mount Pleasant police officers at Remley's Point boat landing and took them back to the spot.",Mount Pleasant,,,Charleston,"August 20, 2006 11:29",0,NA,Dental information / charting is available and entered,Sample submitted - Tests complete,Adult - Pre 20,,no soft tissue recovered,,,0,NA,Fingerprint information is currently not available,,0,NA,Unknown or Completely Bald,no hair recovered,0,",

Mr. Hurst was out on bond having been arrested for shooting another individual. Mr. Hurst's ex-wife paid for his plane fare to the Bahamas. Mr. Hurst and another man were reportedly (by an informant) taken to the airport runway in Marsh Harbor, Abacas, Bahamas where they stole a plane belonging to a man from West Palm Beach. The plane crashed shortly after take-off and was allegedly witnessed by the informant. The informant advised Naples Police Department and the bail bondsman who retrieved the remains from the crash and brought them to Naples where they were examined by the medical examiner and later by a forensic anthropologist. The anthropologist determined the co-mingled remains to be those of two males; one an approximately 50 year old white male and the other a younger individual around 20 years old. The passenger of the plane was believed to be a Colombian national. The Naples Police Department does not accept the presumptive identification and consider Mr. Hurst still at large.","Abacas, Bahamas",,,Collier,"September 17, 1982 00:00",0,NA,Dental information / charting is currently not available,Sample submitted - Tests complete,Adult - Pre 60,,,,,0,NA,Fingerprint information is currently not available,,0,NA,,,0,",

He gave the hair to police the same day.   On July 11, 2011 a lifeguard located a small amount of human hair and other accessories while walking along the beach in front of Ocean Village, Bethany Beach. He turned over the hair and other accessories to the police.  Another fisherman also caught quantity of hair in ocean while surf casting from beach north of Fenwick Island, DE. 

The hair presented as human and DNA analysis subsequently determined the hair was human.  The hair was co-mingled with prescription glasses, identifiable as ""Fossil"" brand, model Mitchell ODR5 140.  Additional items included multicolor hair elastics and shark tooth necklace with word REP DOM on back.

3. A dirtied white shoelace with clumps of hair entangled within.

4. A mottled brown-and orange piece of string or narrow bore twine with an approximate diameter of 1 mm.

5. What appears to be a five strand strip of 3 neon red and 2 neon blue cording with an approximate diameter of 1.5 to 2 mm for each cord.  

6. A blue puka-type bracelet containing alternating tan to white seashells, white puka shells  and light tan and dark tan brown beads.  There is no obvious closure mechanism, therefore it is thought that the shells and beads are strung on elastic cording.  The puka shells appear to be approximately 3 mm in diameter and the tan and white seashells appear to be approximately 6 mm wide by 8 mm high.

Age at death
The remains are adult, as evidenced by the complete fusion of the proximal and distal epiphyses. There is no sign of arthritic change at the joint surface margins and no apparent reduction in bone density. Estimated age is 16 to 50 at the outside of the range, and probably 20 or older.

Sex
The femur is that of a male, based on its length and surface area of the articular joints. The femoral head diameter is 47 mm, within the likely male-only range.

Population Ancestry
Ancestry is probably African-American, based on its extremely long (501 mm) and slender shaft morphology that is (a) flattened in the anterior-posterior dimension, (b) lacks anterior-posterior curvature, and (c) lacks torsion. FORDISC 3 classifies the femur as “black male” with an F typicality of .583 and posterior probability of .818.

Stature
Stature was estimated using the formula for 20th century black males from Fordisc 3.0, calculated at 95% confidence level: mean 70.9 inches; range 67.2 to 74.6 inches.

INDIVIDUATION AND IDENTIFICATION
Discrete traits and anomalies (inherited and acquired)
The femoral neck exhibits plaque.
Pathology and evidence of medical history
No evidence of pathological conditions was found.
Procedures undertaken to identify remains
None at this time.

SUMMARY
This is an adult human femur, recovered from the bottom of the Indian River by a fisherman in 2007. The remains are those of male, estimated age range 16-50 (most likely 20-50), probably African-American, approximately 67.2 to 74.6 inches tall. The estimated postmortem interval is two or more years prior to 2007.",Delaware,0,NA,1,",

Stone Memorial St. Joseph Peninsula State Park in Port St. Joe, Florida to collect seashells.

The woman held onto the mandible for many years until August of 1998 when she mailed the mandible to her niece that lived in Greenfield, Wisconsin.  Once the niece received the mandible in the mail she took it to the Greenfield Police Department who brought the mandible to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office (MCMEO) for analysis in 1998.  The mandible was determined to be human and will be sent for DNA and anthropological analysis at the University of North Texas – Center for Human Identification.

The City of Port Saint Joe Police Department and the District 14 Florida Medical Examiner’s Office have been contacted and notified about this case.

""Growing up, my parents used to take my sister and me to Ft. Lauderdale (Lauderdale-By-the-Sea was where we stayed) for winter vacations.  One year, it was probably around 1959, I found a human jaw bone washed up on the beach with a single molar tooth still intact.  I brought it home, showed it to my dentist to confirm that it was a human bone, and kept it in my room for some years and then lost track of it.  My wife and I recently sold our home of 35 years and moved to a condo.  In the process, I found a box of things from my childhood and the jaw bone was in it.

It occurred to me after watching a documentary recently about solutions to cold cases, that maybe you would have an interest in me sending this item to you.  In jest, I said to my wife, 'This could be Jimmy Hoffa's jaw bone!'
