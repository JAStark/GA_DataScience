**Questions....**
Do I want the data as-is to be represented in the pandas df?
Instead, do I want to code just "presence" or "absence" of data being entered in each field?
In pandas, can I have 2 layers of column headings?

I have 8147 cases ...missing 2356 cases...
in html_files2 = 463 cases
in final_project = 6253

Current total = 14863

NamUs current total = 12390 (10524 OPEN)... what is wrong!?
