One such site, funded by the Department of Justice, is the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) which does this at the nationwide level. It consists of three databases: Missing Persons, Unidentified Persons, and Unclaimed Persons. This project focusses on data from the [Unidentifed Persons](https://identifyus.org/en) database.  "

    "Data were scraped using BeautifulSoup4 and Requests. The data were scraped from the site by looping though case numbers with `range(0, 14000)` using [Namus_scrape2.py](./Namus_scrape2.py). This script called [get_html.py](get_html.py) which submit the request using the case number from Namus_scrape2.py, and made it look nice with BeautfulSoup4, and saved it to an html file identifed by case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, data was extracted and put into a dataframe using [Namus_fromFile.py](./Namus_fromFile.py) and [get_namus_fromFile.py](get_namus_fromFile.py). These scripts again created a range of case numbers to loop through, identify a case.html file, called get_namus_fromFile.py to collect the specific data from that html file, and then append it to a list. At the end, the list would be converted to a dataframe. Originally, the two steps were performed in one: loop through the case numbers, submit a request to the website, save to an html file, extract the data, append to a list, and create a dataframe. All data was extracted from the HTML as is, except for images which were converted to a count, rather than getting the actual images themselves. The idea being that more pictures might lead to a higher identification potential and the fact that I was not going to get into image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** The number of case files collected were fewer than the number of cases on the website. Not every number has a case (for example, if it has been solved, that case number will no longer be available). But I was missing more than just solved cases, which was made clear when I found cases on the website that I did *not* have on file. It is possible that the missing cases were due to a timeout issue. Whatever the cause, it was fixed when I called **get_html** and **get_namus_fromFile** separately. The loop was rewritten to avoid collecting html files that I already had, and only collected the files it had previously missed. These were stored in a separate directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once all the html files were collected, and all the data from them collected, a dataframe consisting of the first \"batch\" of data was created and pickled. The same was done for the second \"missing data\" batch. I kept them separate to begin with in case the reason they were missed initially was due to something about the data itself. Once unpickled (same process as reading in a csv) the two dataframes were joined together to achieve a complete dataset, which you can see in [this notebook](./namus_testing.ipynb). "
